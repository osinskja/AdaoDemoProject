1. Strategy vs Decorator:
In Decorator pattern we can add behaviour to and modify the method we decorate, but we need to provide some default behaviour for it.
In Strategy pattern we can only modify the behaviour of the method we set strategy for, but we do not have to provide the default behaviour.
